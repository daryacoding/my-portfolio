                <p>
                    My fascination with technology began with my love for film and video games. I got my start with a few college courses in Computer Science where I learned to code in Java and about 
                    data structures and algorithms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 6 years of experience in human resources and recruiting I developed interpersonal, problem-solving, and communication skills. 
                    I decided on a career change and decided to enroll in the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp where I learned 
                    team collaboration strategies to work on software development.

                    In the future, I see myself in an organization that values autonomy and innovation, and which would help me develop my creative and problem-solving
                    skills and offer more opportunites for growth.
