                <p>
                    I am a problem-solver looking to break into the field of Tech.
                    I am a recent General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive graduate Student who learned team collaboration strategies to work on software development.
                    For the past 6 years, I have worked in human resources and recruiting where I developed interpersonal, problem-solving, and communication skills.
                    In the future, I see myself in an organization that values autonomy and innovation, and which would help me develop my creative and problem-solving
                    skills and offer more opportunites for growth.
